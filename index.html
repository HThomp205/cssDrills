        <h2>Shoe Knows</h2>
        <p>
          The <span>shoes</span> had been there for as long as anyone could
          remember. In fact, it was difficult for anyone to come up with a date
          they had first appeared. It had seemed they'd always been there and
          yet they seemed so out of place. Why nobody had removed them was a
          question that had been asked time and again, but while they all
          thought it, nobody had ever found the energy to actually do it. So,
          the shoes remained on the steps, out of place in one sense, but
          perfectly normal in another.

        <h2>The Midas Touch</h2>
        <p>
          They decided to find the end of the <span>rainbow</span>. While they
          hoped they would find a pot of gold, neither of them truly believed
          that the mythical pot would actually be there. Nor did they believe
          they could actually find the end of the rainbow. Still, it seemed like
          a fun activity for the day, and pictures of them chasing rainbows
          would look great on their Instagram accounts. They would have never
          believed they would actually find the end of a rainbow, and when they
          did, what they actually found there.

        <h2>Mirror Mirror</h2>
        <p>
          She had a terrible habit o comparing her <span>life</span> to others.
          She realized that their life experiences were completely different
          than her own and that she saw only what they wanted her to see, but
          that didn't matter. She still compared herself and yearned for what
          she thought they had and she didn't.

        <h2>Sadge</h2>
        <p>
          He had <span>disappointed</span> himself more than anyone else. That
          wasn't to say that he hadn't disappointed others. The fact was that he
          had disappointed a lot of people who were close to him. The fact that
          they were disappointed in him was something that made him even more
          disappointed in himself. Yet here he was, about to do the exact same
          things that had caused all the disappointment in the first place
          because he didn't know what else to do.
